# Services required for exam work

This directory contains the server-side services required for the projects to be done. Each API contains tasks with similar difficulties, but the requriements are different.
In each case the end result is expected to be a **React based application written in TypeScript** using the services of the choosen API.

## Requirements
- Solving the tasks happens in **teamwork** helping the others work as well, not individually.
- Each team should nominate a team member to be the team lead and establish a common git repository. 
- Tasks of the team lead:
  - Distribute the tasks between members and organize the work
  - Handle conflicts within the team and escalate issues towards the lecturers if necessary
  - Works together with the members as well on the tasks
  - Represent the team during the exam and provide a short overall about the application to be shown
  - Having 1 additional point which can be used for correcting the grad of his own or another team member when it's not insufficient (1 / F)
- The created application is expected to contain all prescribed functions mentioned in the requirements of each tasks.
- You work together only within the team, using help of third parties is forbidden!
- Solving a task is expected to happen in the teams own repository as a Pull Request. Direct main/master commits are not allowed.
- On the final exam the team leader presents the created application in a short review, showing the main functionalities. After this each member has to show the details which they accomplished.
- You're expected to defend the code you created, otherwise the grade is insufficient.
- In case of plagiarism each affected student are excluded - supplementary exam is only possible on their case if they managed to fulfill the preliminary exam.

## Thechnical details
- The created application has to be done using the React library, using third party NPM packages if necessary.
- There's no limitation regarding the design, it's up to you.
- Using Fetch API while communicating with the server is mandatory - having a different package to handle this (e.g. axios) is forbidden - the project submitted in this way are not accepted.
- The pages should not reload during internal navigation, follow the Single Page Application principles.
- If the task requires a popup window, confirmation or notification using the methods of the `window` object is **forbidden** - use a stylized window in each case.
- The team lead is expected to send the link of the repository 2 days before the exam. The mail should contain:
  - The name and Neptun code of team members
  - The choosen API
  - link of the Git repository where the whole application can be found

## Evaluation
Each task has points depending on the difficulty level. One point mean one grad, a student can earn at max 5 (indenpedently from the solved problems). When the student failed to complete the preliminary exam then the grade will be the avarage of the received 2 or 3 grades altogether.

## Possibility of correction
There's one additional chance to correct the failed exam with the previosly mentioned exception - in this case the student has to solve a different task within two weeks.
